# The [Design Archives](https://archives.design/)
### is an attempt to create a curated and easier to browse design repository for the [Internet Archives](https://archive.org)

This project was put together by [Valery Marier](https://marier.design/about) because she needed a better curation system than the *'favourites'* section on the Internet Archive. This website is a Jekyll blog hosted on Github Pages. The site was based on the theme [Alembic](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic) by David Darnes and is released under the same MIT License. The website is typeset in IBM Plex Mono.

## Like to help out?
This is an open source project! If you've found an interesting design related item on the Internet Archives and would like to add it to the collection, submit it as a todo on the repository. Also, if you happen to have any backend coding experience and would like to contribute a better organization system to this project than my patched together Jekyll blog it would be greatly appreciated.
