Design with Type was first published in 1952 and appeared in this multi-award-winning revised edition in 1967, which was the first Canadian work to be named Book of the Year by the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA). Its author, Carl Dair (1912-1967) was one of Canada's best-known and most celebrated type compositors and designers.

Discussing type as a design material as well as a means of communication, Dair argued that if type is understood in terms of design, the user of type will be better able to work with it to achieve maximum clarity and aesthetic pleasure. He guides the reader through a study of typography that starts with the examination of an individual letter and proceeds with words, lines, and masses of text.<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1834794.Design_with_Type" title="An excerpt from Good Reads" class="footnote">&ordm;</a>
