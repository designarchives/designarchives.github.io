Its author, Carl Dair (1912-1967) was one of Canada’s best-known and most celebrated type compositors and designers.\n\nDiscussing type as a design material as well as a means of communication, Dair argued that if type is understood in terms of design, the user of type will be better able to work with it to achieve maximum clarity and aesthetic pleasure. He guides the reader through a study of typography that starts with the examination of an individual letter and proceeds with words, lines, and masses of text.º\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Author\n    Carl Dair\n  \n  \n    Publication Date\n    1967\n  \n  \n    Publisher\n    University of Toronto Press\n  \n  \n    Collection\n    Duke University Libraries\n  \n  \n    Language\n    English\n  \n  \n    Identifier-ark\n    ark:/13960/t5cc68x8x\n  \n  \n    Tags\n    Carl Dair, Typography, Type, Letters, Canada, Canadian, Modernism\n  \n  \n    Rights\n    Seems to be out of copyright in Canada\n  \n\n\nOriginally from the Internet Archive\n",

    "content": "This project was put together by Valery Marier because she needed a better curation system than the ‘favourites’ section on the Internet Archive. This website is a Jekyll blog hosted on Github Pages. The site was based on the theme Alembic by David Darnes and is released under the same MIT License. The website is typeset in IBM Plex Mono.\n\nLike to help out?\nThis is an open source project, you can view the Github repository here. If you’ve found an interesting design related item on the Internet Archives and would like to add it to the collection, submit it as a todo on the repository. Also, if you happen to have any backend coding experience and would like to contribute a better organization system to this project than my patched together Jekyll blog it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nItem types\nDue to the vast nature of the Internet Archive, there are certain items that can and can’t be accessed/downloaded on demand. For the purposes of this collection I have divided the posts into three types:\n\n\n  §stream_only is for items that can only be viewed on the archive’s website and cannot be downloaded.\n  §borrow_only is for items that can only be viewed on the archive’s website if you–the user–creates an account and digitally borrows it from the library. These can generally be downloaded as encrypted files that only work for the specific loan period.\n  §always_available is for items that can be viewed, downloaded, or embedded in perpetuity.\n\n",
