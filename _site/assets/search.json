Its author, Carl Dair (1912-1967) was one of Canada’s best-known and most celebrated type compositors and designers.\n\nDiscussing type as a design material as well as a means of communication, Dair argued that if type is understood in terms of design, the user of type will be better able to work with it to achieve maximum clarity and aesthetic pleasure. He guides the reader through a study of typography that starts with the examination of an individual letter and proceeds with words, lines, and masses of text.º\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Author\n    Carl Dair\n  \n  \n    Publication Date\n    1967\n  \n  \n    Publisher\n    University of Toronto Press\n  \n  \n    Collection\n    Duke University Libraries\n  \n  \n    Language\n    English\n  \n  \n    Identifier-ark\n    ark:/13960/t5cc68x8x\n  \n  \n    Tags\n    Carl Dair, Typography, Type, Letters, Canada, Canadian, Modernism\n  \n  \n    Rights\n    Seems to be out of copyright in Canada\n  \n\n\nOriginally from the Internet Archive\n",
