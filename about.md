title: About this project.
---

This project was put together by <a href="https://marier.design/about">Valery Marier</a> because she needed a better curation system than the *'favourites'* section on the Internet Archive. This website is a Jekyll blog hosted on Github Pages. The site was based on the theme <a href="https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic">Alembic</a> by David Darnes and is released under the same MIT License. The website is typeset in IBM Plex Mono.

## Like to help out?
This is an open source project, <a href="https://github.com/designarchives/designarchives.github.io">you can view the Github repository here</a>. If you've found an interesting design related item on the Internet Archives and would like to add it to the collection, submit it as a todo on the repository. Also, if you happen to have any backend coding experience and would like to contribute a better organization system to this project than my patched together Jekyll blog it would be greatly appreciated.

## Item types
Due to the vast nature of the Internet Archive, there are certain items that can and can't be accessed/downloaded on demand. For the purposes of this collection I have divided the posts into three types:

- <a href="#stream_only" class="stream_only">&sect;stream_only</a> is for items that can only be viewed on the archive's website and cannot be downloaded.
- <a href="#borrow_only" class="borrow_only">&sect;borrow_only</a> is for items that can only be viewed on the archive's website if you–the user–creates an account and digitally borrows it from the library. These can generally be downloaded as encrypted files that only work for the specific loan period.
- <a href="#always_available" class="always_available">&sect;always_available</a> is for items that can be viewed, downloaded, or embedded in perpetuity.
