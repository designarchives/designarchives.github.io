title: About this project.
---

This project was put together by <a href="https://marier.design/about">Valery Marier</a> because she needed a better curation system than the *'favourites'* section on the Internet Archive. This website is a Jekyll blog hosted on Github Pages. The site was based on the theme <a href="https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic">Alembic</a> by David Darnes and is released under the same MIT License. The website is typeset in IBM Plex Mono.
